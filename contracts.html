                <h3>THIS FORMAL ONLINE BINDING DOCUMENT IS CREATED WITH THE INTENTION OF INTRODUCING
                    PEACE AND EASE IN OUR DAILY COMMUNICATION THROUGH ONLINE CHAT. THIS AGREEMENT WAS
                    ORIGINALLY CREATED DUE TO OUR OVERWHELMING BUSY SCHEDULE AND DIFFERENT TIME
                    ZONES. MOREOVER, THIS CONTRACT IS ORIGINAL, EVEN THO IT IS A SOFT COPY ONLINE, IT DOES
                    CONTAIN AN OFFICIAL ONLINE SIGNATURE ON THE FRONT PAGE AND ON THE LAST PAGE ON
                    BEHALF OF BOTH OF US. FURTHERMORE, THIS LEGAL AGREEMENT SHOULD NOT BE SHARED

                    <h2>ARTICLE 1: CHATTING/MESSAGING TIMES AND SCHEDULE COMPROMISE</h2>
                <p>{{S.S (1)}} - The days that we are allowed to communicate are NOT limited/restricted, any day is fine.<br><br>{{S.S (2)}} - The timings for our messaging (TWO SESSIONS) will be around or between 7 AM to 12 PM
                    (Canadian Time)/ 6 AM to 11 PM (Dubai Time, related to Canadian, Surrey BC Time). The second
                    session of our chatting timings will be around or between 7 PM to 11 PM (Canadian Time)/ 6 AM to 10
                    AM (Dubai Time). If any doubts or concerns you have regarding the timings, you can let the creator of
                    this document know since timings could be flexible due to the large difference between our time zone.<br><br>{{S.S (3)}} - Please do abide by these rules as it will create more convenience between us and will help
                    us get a chance to talk more. Note the available free times mentioned above and try to chat with me
                    during those times; I will also try my best and make an effort to make time for you during the
                    mentioned times above. All of our necessary work should be over by then giving us plenty of time to
                    chat. Note, the times can be flexible, so if I am in Canada, while you wake up early say 6 AM or 7 AM,
                    you will have a chance to talk with me because it will be 8 PM or 11 PM in my place. Nevertheless, if
                    you try to chat with me during the afternoons or evenings, then it will be hard/impossible since it will
                    be nighttime/midnight at my place!</p><br><br>
                    <h2>ARTICLE 2: CHATTING TOPICS AND OTHER RELATED BUSINESS GOING ON IN OUR LIFE/ UPDATES/
                        CATCHING UP</h2>
                        <p>{{S.S (1)}} - As per our chatting scheduled time above, if something new happens that may seem
                            intriguing or worth sharing with your closest friend, feel free to spread that news without hesitating.
                            If the news tends to be a private matter or for personal reasons, then you or I have every right to not
                            share or talk about it unless we trust each other enough to keep it a secret between US only. (That
                            excludes our parents, siblings, other friends, spouses, children, strangers, and others whom we will
                            meet in the future)<br><br>{{S.S (2)}} - Our text messages/ voice messages/ anything related to our private topic of discussion
                            remains confidential and not to be shared with ANYONE (that includes your Mother, Father, Sister,
                            your entire relatives/cousins, new and old friends, partners, co-workers, teachers, advisors, and
                            everyone WITHOUT MY CONSENT). You are also forbidden to share our chats by taking screenshots
                            and all WITHOUT MY CONSENT, the same rule applies to me as well.<br><br>{{S.S (3)}} - Whenever we share our news or something new that has happened in our life, we can/need
                            to address them or acknowledge them.</p><br><br>
                    <h2>ARTICLE 3: SOCIAL PLATFORM FOR CHATTING</h2>
                    <p>{{S.S (1)}} - We are ONLY allowed to communicate through WhatsApp or Instagram. When one sends a
                        message to either of these platforms, one should reply to either of these platforms. Make sure that
                        you stay aware and check both platforms. I on the other hand use Instagram a lot due to my work
                        there, so you can expect more messages from me over there.<br><br>{{S.S (2)}} - You are encouraged to share any kind of reels or posts on Instagram, rather than on
                        WhatsApp.</p><br><br>
                    <h2>ARTICLE 4: VIEWING THE TEXT MESSAGES SENT FROM YOU OR ME AND REPLYING BACK POLICY AND
                        TEXT MESSAGE/ VOICE MESSAGE LIMITS</h2>
                        <p>{{S.S (1)}} - If I or you have not seen or replied to your message within any scheduled time period, you
                            or I are allowed to reply back to those messages whenever we want or feel like it. I highly encourage
                            you (the same goes for me as well) to send a short code (s or S for you/ t or T for me) when you have
                            seen my messages but are not able to reply to me. Say I sent you a few texts, but you are busy,
                            however, IF and only IF you have SEEN my messages then send your short code as written above
                            which will let me know that you have seen it, you are busy and will reply to me back as you have
                            acknowledged that you got my messages and that you did not ignore it. However, if you got my text
                            messages but have not seen them, then you can leave it be. Note, do not send me another one of
                            your own short code or another code you think is better, as long as it is convenient for you and also
                            QUICK ENOUGH for you to type and send me when you are extremely busy and in a hurry, then fine.
                            However, other than that please stick with what the agreement says otherwise it will be a serious
                            offense to this contract of ours. This is a matter of our safety as well!<br><br>{{S.S (2)}} - Your text messages have the freedom/choice to be as long or short as they can get, and your
                            voice message, however, cannot exceed the standard limit which is 3 minutes MAX (3:00). If your
                            voice message exceeds this limit, say 1-5 MINUTES or even 1-5 SECONDS or so, then your voice
                            message would be considered disavowed and cease to exist from my device no matter what the case
                            is, even if it's urgent or emergency. Short voice messages are highly recommended for better
                            chatting and saving time and energy.</p><br><br>
                    <h2>ARTICLE 5: GROUPS FOR CHATTING (IF IN ANY CASE)</h2>
                    <p>{{S.S (1)}} -If we are added to any kind of group (added either by you or me), all the rules will apply here.
                        Of course, the rules do not apply when you are chatting with others, but when it comes to us; the
                        rules apply unless it is an urgent or serious matter.</p><br><br>
                    <h2>ARTICLE 6: CALLING AND CHATTING THROUGH ZOOM/GOOGLE MEET/TELECOM/BOTIM/ETC.</h2>
                    <p>{{S.S (1)}} - The timings and schedules of calling and chatting are the same as the one mentioned in
                        Article 1 sub-sections (1) & (2). Once again, the timings can be flexible.<br><br>{{S.S (2)}} - Through online calling and chatting, under no circumstances will my face exposure remains
                        open, it will bear to minimum or no exposure at all. You are also ORDERED not to force me
                        emotionally or in any other way to open my webcam.<br><br>{{S.S (3)}} - While calling, you are not allowed to leave me hanging by doing your own work while I am
                        just sitting and listening to your mumbles and humming noises. This type of stuff should already be
                        taken care of before our call. Any work you have that is not related to me, postpone it or do it before
                        our meeting. Once again, this rule applies to me as well.</p><br><br>
                    <h2>ARTICLE 7: MAINTAINING OUR MATURITY WHEN DEALING WITH HARDSHIPS AND POLICIES REGARDING
                        OUR SAFETY IN CASE OF ANY DANGER</h2>
                        <p>{{S.S (1)}} - No matter what hardships or obstacles we have faced, are facing, or will face, we both agree
                            notto stay or be depressed, sad, or despairing. Remember we are not alone and also our religion and
                            faith. Neither of us is allowed to have a serious cranky mature dull face or tone when we talk to each
                            other by any means (texting, voice message, FaceTime). Maturity does not mean being serious and
                            dull. You and I both know and are fully aware of what maturity TRULY means.<br><br>{{S.S (2)}} -If any of us are in danger, trouble, or any serious related stuff, it is mandatory for you or me
                            to help each other out by reaching out for help. It is obligatory for us to not feel ashamed or think
                            maybe it is not the right time to text him (perhaps he is busy etc), and this will automatically become
                            a serious offense to this agreement! No matter what the situation or time is, we have to reach each
                            other for help. If digital communication or reach is impossible for us for some reason, then the
                            mailing/ post mail option is open for both of us.<br><br>{{S.S (3)}} - I advise you to write down my phone number on a piece of paper laminate it with
                            plastic/transparent tape and keep it somewhere safe WITH YOU so that if your device (any of the
                            kind) stops working, then you will at least have my contact saved with you out of the digital form.<br><br>{{S.S (4)}} -If our device is stolen or hacked, we should keep or have a secret code message that proves
                            that I am talking to you or you are talking to me and not someone else who is trying to imitate us.
                            Our secret code message is the following series of questions and answers and it is required for BOTH
                            OF US to MEMORISE it and REMEMBER it AT ALL TIMES! It is also recommended not to change any
                            single piece of this message (punctuation, spelling, capital letters, format, pattern, etc) and delete
                            this very secret code message after its use so that no one can copy it by hacking, etc:<br><br>(Q) What is the way?<br>= One way.<br>(Q) One way?<br>= The true and just way.</p><br><br>
